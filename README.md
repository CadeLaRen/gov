# Skeleton Go Project

Base project for go stuffs. Probably not #gonuts compatible.

# Working and Building

Don't panic. We have a Makefile. The makefile manages the *project*
not the binary build. This way you can make a deb, rpm, man page, etc.

It *can* make a binary build, of course, but that is just a useful
thing, not general way of building.

If you want to work on this and have a workspace and everything set up
for you, my recommendation is to do this:

    $ make activate
    
This sets up the workspace, moves you into it in a subprocess, etc. To
stop working on the project just exit the sub-shell (C-d or
<code>exit</code>). 

You will need to modify both the Makefile in <code>master</code> and
<code>project</code> branches to use the proper package name and
binary name (the first two lines in the Makefile), but aside from that
things should Just Work.

# Versions, Release, Tags, and Branches 

We make releases, master is not always the best choice of branches to
use. When we make a release we'll merge the current release into the
<code>go1</code> branch. We'll also tag it, so you can get the exact
version you want.

If we make a backwards incompatible change, it will be a new project.
To put it differently, the <code>go1</code> branch will *always* be
backwards compatible.

# Working with this Project 

So, this project has (or will have shortly) stuff for buildings debs,
man pages, etc. This doesn't fit neatly into the <code>go
get</code>-able model (though it can). I also have beliefs about
workspace-per-project which are not widely held in the greater go
community. In the interest of accomodating everyone, the project is
<code>go get</code> friendly, but still has its own full workspace,
etc. How do we do this you ask? I am glad you asked!

You can checkout the <code>project</code> branch and run make to build
a workspace. You can then run <code>make activate</code> to enter the
workspace and do you stuff! It will drop you in a local checkout of
this project, inside the workspace.

Finally, as I don't hold with master always being perfectly stable,
there is a <code>go1</code> branch which is always the most current
release. <code>go get</code> prefers <code>go1</code> to
<code>master</code> so folks who want to rely on it as a library, or
install it via <code>go get</code> will get the most recent release,
rather than the most recent checkin to master.

If you hate all of this, ignore it. Pull requests, <code>go get</code>
etc all work as with any other Go project.
